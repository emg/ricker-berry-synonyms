<!-- The g element is a single-tag element which is used to encode a
single word in Greek script. 

The attribute "beta" is the Greek word in BETA encoding.

The attribute "strongs" is the word's number in the Strong's encoding
system.  It is not prefixed by G, but is simply a sequence of digits
0-9.  If this attribute is missing, it means that there is no
equivalent Strong's number.

The attribute "head" is either true or false.  When true, it
designates that the Greek word should stand out, e.g. in bold or with
a color, because it is a promninent mention of a word being defined in
the current section.

The optional attribute "ref", when true, denotes that the word in
question does not belong in this section, but can be found in another
section of the synonyms dictionary.  When the value is "external", the
word in question is not found in the dictionary.

The optional attribute "entry" is only present if and only if
ref==true. In that case, "entry" is the number of the entry in which
the word belongs.
